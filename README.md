# Assignment-Three
You are part of a team of data analysts that was contracted by Turtle Games, a game manufacturer and retailer with a global customer base. The company manufactures and sells its own products, along with sourcing and selling products manufactured by other companies. Its product range includes books, board games, video games, and toys. The company collects data from sales as well as customer reviews. Turtle Games has a business objective of improving overall sales performance by utilising customer trends.  

To improve overall sales performance, Turtle Games has come up with an initial set of questions. You’ll explore these questions in greater depth through the weekly assignment activities. Turtle Games wants to understand: 

how customers accumulate loyalty points
how groups within the customer base can be used to target specific market segments 
how social data (e.g. customer reviews) can be used to inform marketing campaigns
the impact that each product has on sales
how reliable the data is (e.g. normal distribution, skewness, or kurtosis)
what the relationship(s) is/are (if any) between North American, European, and global sales? 


Turtle Games provided your team with two data sets (CSV files) and metadata (TXT file) ensuring that you can perform the analysis needed to complete the assignment. Employ your Python and R programming skills to assist Turtle Games in answering the posed questions.

The files are: 

turtle_reviews.csv – Details on customer gender, age, remuneration, spending score, loyalty points, education, language, platform, review and summary across products.
turtle_sales.csv – Details of video games sold globally, such as the rank, product, platform, genre, publisher, and their sales across North America, Europe, and worldwide.
metadata_turtle_games.txt – Details of the data set, data quality, and reference.
LSE_DA301_Assignment_Python_template.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook assignment template file with notes and tips on the assignment activities of Weeks 1 to 3.
LSE_DA301_Assignment_R_template.R – R script assignment template file with notes and tips on the assignment activities of Weeks 4 to 6.



WEEK ONE: Make predictions with regression.

You’ll apply linear regression techniques to determine how customers accumulate loyalty points. For the final:

Jupyter Notebook you should indicate your process of importing the relevant data set with the Pandas library, and storing the data in a DataFrame. You’ll also need to create, fit, and determine the accuracy of a regression model. 
report you will provide a summary of the process you followed to create, fit, and improve the accuracy of the regression model.
presentation you will describe the process you followed, indicate what you observed, and explain how you approached the analysis of loyalty points.

WEEK TWO: Make predictions with clustering.

You’ll apply k-means clustering to determine how useful remuneration and spending scores are in providing data for analysis. For the final:

Jupyter Notebook you should indicate your process of importing the necessary libraries and preparing the data for clustering. You’ll also need to create, fit, and determine the accuracy of a clustering model. 
report you will provide a summary of the process you followed to create, fit, and improve the accuracy of the clustering model.
presentation you will describe the process you followed, indicate what you observed, and explain how you approached to identify groups within the customer base that can be used to target specific market segments. 

WEEK THREE: Analyse customer sentiments with reviews.

You’ll apply natural language processing (NLP) to determine how social data (e.g. customer reviews) can be used to inform marketing campaigns. For the final:

Jupyter Notebook you should indicate your process of importing the relevant data set with the Pandas library, and storing the data in a DataFrame. You’ll also need to demonstrate the process you followed to perform NLP.
report you will provide a summary of the process you followed to identify the 15 most common words and top 20 positive and negative reviews used in online product reviews.
presentation you will describe the process you followed, indicate what you observed, and explain how you approached the NLP analysis.

WEEK FOUR: Visualise data to gather insights.

You’ll explore and prepare the data set for analysis on the impact of sales per product. For the final:

R script you should include a selection of visualisations you created in the search to identify trends as well as your interpretation of the visualisations and rationale for selecting the visualisations you did.
report you need to explain your process and rationale behind the visualisations as well as your interpretation of the outputs.
presentation you will describe the process you followed, indicate what you observed, and explain the trends you’ve identified based on the visual outputs. 


WEEK FIVE: 	Clean, manipulate  and visualise the data.

You’ll perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to clean and manipulate the data so that you determine how reliable the data is (e.g. normal distribution, skewness, or kurtosis). For the final:

R script you will demonstrate your ability to perform statistical analysis and determine the impact on sales per product.
report you need to explain your process and rationale behind the statistical analysis and visualisations created as well as your interpretation of the outputs.
presentation you will describe the process you followed, indicate what you observed, and explain the trends you’ve identified based on the visual outputs. 

WEEK SIX: 	
Making recommendations to the business.

You’ll apply regression techniques to determine any possible relationship(s) in sales between North America, Europe, and global sales. For the final:

R script you should indicate your process of answering the questions by importing data, exploring data sets, analysing data, and creating suitable visualisations. You'll also create, fit, and test the accuracy of a linear regression model.
report you will clearly articulate a response to the questions posed by Turtle Games and summarise your analysis by providing recommendations to Turtle Games. You can also share any obstacles you faced in the process and how you overcame them.
presentation you will describe the process you followed, indicate what you observed, and explain your answers to the questions and possible recommendations to Turtle Games. You can also suggest further questions to explore.
